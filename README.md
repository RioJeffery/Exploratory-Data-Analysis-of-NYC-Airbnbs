# Airbnb 50 Listings Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a sample of 50 Airbnb listings to explore:
- Distribution of listings across neighbourhoods
- Average price per night by room type

The goal is to demonstrate:
- **Data cleaning**
- **Pivot tables**
- **Data visualisation**
- **Analytical reporting**

Findings are based on the sample and may not represent the entire Airbnb market.

## Analysis

### Pivot 1: Average Price by Room Type
- Shows the average price per night for each room type.
- Entire homes/apartments are the most expensive, followed by private rooms, and shared rooms are the least expensive.
- This indicates a relative relationship where larger units tend to be priced higher than smaller or shared accommodations.

### Pivot 2: Listings by Neighbourhood
- Shows the number of listings in each neighbourhood.
- Bedford-Stuyvesant has the highest share (12.2%), while Long Island City, West Village, Murray Hill, Midtown, Bushwick, Clinton Hill, Crown Heights, Flatbush, Greenpoint, and Kensington each have 2%.
- This indicates hosts are more concentrated in certain neighbourhoods. The dataset does not include guest demand or reasons for concentration.
